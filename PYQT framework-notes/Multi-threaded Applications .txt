Multi-threaded Applications :
- threads are an independent set of instructions
	- independent means that they cant interact with each other by normal means
- OS dependent
- Qt provides a platform independent method for using threads
	- QThread class
		- create a worker class that is a subclass of Qthread
		- override the run method in the worker class
		- in you main application create an instance of the worker class
		- call the instances start() method to begin the worker classes run method
		- communicate between main thread and worker thread using signals
			- worker thread has a finished signal that is emitted when the run method finishes
			- you can implement your own custom signals in the worker class to communicate with the main thread
